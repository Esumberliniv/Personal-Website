Project Name: Emery Sumberlin IV - Portfolio

Description:
This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, experience, and projects. 
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site features smooth scrolling navigation, a dropdown contact menu, 
and links to my resume and social media profiles. It highlights my background in cybersecurity, technical expertise, 
and past projects, including my role in the AT&T Innovation Challenge. 
The site serves as both an introduction and a professional hub for potential employers, collaborators, and recruiters.
